            <p>One of a few countries including Greece, Egypt, Persia, India and China, that can measure it's history in millenium. It also measures it's history by a single man, the emperor. Possibly more than any country, it is a country of contrasts. </p>
            <p>Traditional, but modern, Japan has been an imperial aggressor in the past but now may be the only country in the world with a constitution outlawing war in disputes. There is a Bushido code of chivalrous behavior yet a pacifist, nonconfrontational one as well. Japan is a leader of modern industry and still cherishes nature and its beauty.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>An archipelago of nearly 7,000 islands, Japan is a result of subducting tectonic plate movement, with its plate riding over the submerging plate, pulling Japan eastward toward North America. It has created the Sea of Japan and separated it from the mainland. 15,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age, land bridges connected Japan to the Korean peninsula, Siberia, and Taiwan. During this time, the first Paleolithic settlers (Jōmon era people) came to Japan. 14,000 BC, Neolithic (using polished stone tools), semi-sedentary, hunter-gathers settled in Japan. These were the ancestors of the Ainu and Yamato people. Clay pots from this period are some of the oldest examples of pottery. 300 BC, The Yanoi people enter Japan bringing rice cultivation. Japan first appears in written history (as Wa) in the Chinese Book of Han, in 111.</p>

            <h3>Government</h3>
            <p>The national government is a constitutional monarchy. The “Post-war Constitution” or “Peace Constitution” became effective May 3, 1947. It replaced the Meiji Constitution, which came into effect November 29, 1890, after the Meiji Restoration. The Meiji Constitution was a constitutional monarchy (more of an oligarchy), was based on the Prussian and British models at the time, and made the first parliamentary government in Asia. The first constitution of Japan restored the emperor to power, as an active state leader, and took power away from the shogun. The Meiji Restoration was part of a plan to modernize and strengthen Japan and to prevent colonization by foreign powers, like what occurred in China.
            </p>
            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>To understand its culture, you have to understand the cultural principles that are the basis of the society. These basic principles are the basis on which Japanese people behave, think of as beautiful, and their philosophy of life.
            </p>
            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p>A unique cuisine but just like other regional cuisines it is based on resources, culture, climate, history, and hardship. An island nation, no location within it is farther than 150 km (93 miles) from the sea. And with 73% of Japan being mountainous, only 12.8% is agricultural land (USA is 17.1%, India 57%), while 4.8% of the land is residential. In 675, Japan’s Emperor Tenmu banned using livestock and eating wild animals due to Buddhism. In 737, Emperor Seimu allowed fish and shellfish to be eaten. Until the Meiji Restoration, roughly 1200 years, Japan was relatively vegetarian. As an island nation, it typically had very little access to spices. Japan’s continued emphasis on fresh vegetables and seafood in their diet has led to one of the healthiest cultural diets.
            </p>
            <h3>Sites</h3>
            <p>Japan is full of interesting sights to see and experience, from UNESCO World Heritage sights to the world’s largest fish market. It also has the world’s busiest train station at Shinjuku Station, with 3.6 million daily passengers. The size of Japan’s mainland and the smaller islands that are a part of it, make travelling around it as interesting and adventurous as any vacation in Europe. Besides air travel, Japan has an extensive railway system to cities and within cities, local and highway buses, a ferry system between islands, and local taxis and uber service.
