            <h3>Japan has more than one way to designate years in recorded history:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chinese based 60-year cycle calendar using astronomical events has 365 ¼ days per year.</li>
                <li>Gengō (Era) system, based on the beginning of each emperor’s new reign. Still in use.</li>
                <li>Japanese imperial year, based on the date of the legendary founding of Japan by Emperor Jimmu in 660 BC. First used in 1873, it never replaced the era system and was abandoned after WW2.</li>
                <li>Western Common Era system, it came into use in the Meiji period.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Using the Gengō and Common Era system together major events in Japan’s history include:</h3>

            <p><em>Yamato/Kofun period (ca. 250 - 710):</em> Imperial court ruled from modern day Nara. Chinese calendar and religions (Confucianism and Taoism) are imported. Burial mounds (Korfun) for the ruling class, terracotta sculptures (Haniwa) placed near warriors . Buddhism officially introduced in 552 and becomes state religion, along with Confucianism, in 605.
            </p>
            <p><em>Nara period (710 - 784):</em> Spread of written language. The imperial court records and documents its history. Japanese poetry (waka) begins. The Taihō Code is written as an administrative reorganization to implement a complex legal system. The capitol is moved to Kyōto. With the decline of China, Japan begins to look inward.
            </p>
            <p><em>Heian period (794 -1185):</em> Considered the highpoint in Japanese culture. Widespread use of kana in written language occurs. The lyrics for the modern national anthem are written as waka from an unknown author. An unusually long period of peace, some could say it’s a period of economic decline. By 1000, the government no longer knew how to issue currency. Samurai’s begin to take power. The rise of the military class begins along with the military elite and the Bushido Code.

            <p><em>Kamakura period (1185 - 1333):</em> Established by the first shogun, it marks the transition to the Japanese feudal/medieval system. It was a period of disunity and violence that increased the popularization of Buddhism. Two Mongol invasions occurred after Japan rejected the demand by Kublai Khan, then leader if China, to pay tribute. In 1274, 600 ships carrying 23,000 troops sailed to Japan. After a day of fighting, the invading troops were decimated by a sudden typhoon. In 1281, a second invasion occurred. After 7 weeks of fighting, another typhoon destroyed the Mongol fleet. Called the “divine wind/kamikaze” it gave the military class a sense of superiority and leaders a fear of further invasion from the mainland.
            </p>
            <p><em>Muromachi period (1336 - 1573):</em> Daimyos, regional rulers, become stronger while the shogun becomes weaker. The relationship with China was renewed during China’s Ming Dynasty. Art of all kinds flourished during this period. After the “divine wind” saves Japan from invasion, the Jinnōshōtōki is written providing a Shinto view of Japanese history, emphasizing the emperor as a deity, and the divine nature of the Japanese and their spiritual supremacy over others. Shinto becomes a popular belief again and a nationalistic force. The Onin War leads to fragmentation and virtually no central control. By 1500 almost the entire country was in a civil war. At the end of the period, 1543, the first Europeans arrive bringing firearms, glass, clocks and tobacco. Christianity arrives in 1549, and by 1582 there are 150,000 converts, but as Japan becomes more unified and less open, by 1587, the religion begins to be prohibited.
            </p>
            <p><em>Azuchi-Momoyama/Sengoku period (1568 -1600):</em> Unification of Japan through war occurred and interest in the outside world increased. Trade missions to Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand were sent. 200,000 Japanese troops invade Korea. After a crushing naval loss, and a second invasion attempt, the attempted conquering of China failed.

            <p><em>Edo period (1603 - 1867):</em> During this period only China and the Dutch East India Company could visit Japan. Other Europeans who landed were put to death. Known as the beginning of Japan’s early modern period. Economic development and neo-Confucianism leads Japan away from the feudal system. “Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life.” Urban dwellers have more leisure time. Study of science and mathematics was encouraged. Fashion and entertainment become widely sought. In 1707 Mount Fuji erupts for 15 days. In 1853, Commodore Perry enters Edo Bay with his 4 “black ships” to open Japan.
            </p>
            <p><em>Meiji Era (1868 - 1912):</em> Japan starts its modernization and becomes a world power. The Meiji (meaning enlightened rule, given posthumously) Restoration ended the 265-yearold feudalistic Tokugawa shogunate and returned power to the emperor from the shōgun. Disgruntled samurai had feared, after Perry’s show of force, that Japan had become too weak compared to Western military. The aim was to restore national pride and power, by modernizing. Besides being a military modernization, it was an economic and cultural revolution, changing dressing and eating habits, the political, military, economic and educational system. Japanese scholars were sent abroad to study western systems and technologies while Westerners were invited into Japan to develop new industries, like beer, dairy and the first railroads.

            <p><em>Taishō Period (1912 - 1926): </em> A shift in political power from the genro (older statesmen) to the parliament and democratic parties started. Economic and political Meiji Restoration objectives are fulfilled, Japan’s urban society develops, without suffering through the western colonization like other east Asian countries. Universal suffrage, social welfare, workers’ rights, and nonviolent protest occurred.
            <p></p>
            <p>During WW I, while Germany was involved in the European war, Japan declared war on Germany and expanded into German-leased territories in China. Despite being called one of the “Big Five” at the Versailles peace conference and being given a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations, Japan was rejected in its effort to put a racial equality clause in the Versailles peace treaty (later included in the 1945 UN Charter). Rejected largely by Australia and the United States, the alienation increased Japan’s nationalism and militarism leading to WWII.</p>
            <p>Although postwar Japan was in unprecedented prosperity, the assassination of 2 prime ministers (1921 and 1931) and attempted assassination of Prince Hirohito showed how unstable the society was. In response to the threat of communism, the government passed the Peace Preservation Law (1925) – forbidding any change in the political structure or abolition of private property. The Japan Communist Party is banned. Ultra-nationalistic political societies become active in domestic and foreign policies. The Unites States becomes more of a presence in Asia, once a source for loans and imported goods, its goals include to curtail Japanese imperialism. Chinese Nationalism and civil unrest lead to The Nine Power Treaty (1922), countries agree to not interfere in China’s attempt to establish a stable government and Japan withdraws troops from Shandong and Siberia.

            <p><em>Shōwa Period (1926 - 1989):</em> (Shōwa meaning enlightened peace). During the reign of Emperor Hirohito, the longest of all emperors, it was a time of imperialism.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Expansionism:</em>
                    Due to its lack of national resources, colonies were needed to compete with European powers. Manchuria invaded and conquered (1932). Japan signs an anti-communism treaty with Germany and Italy (1936). Japan takes control of coastal China (1937)</li>
                <li><em>Occupation:</em>
                    1945 Emperor Hirohito accepts the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and Japan surrenders. Douglas MacArthur is appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers to supervise Japan. First 2 priorities were to set up a food network and gain the support of the emperor. Some of the accomplishments of the occupation include sword disarmament, financial and industrial partnerships dissolved, land reform, democratization (abolished nobility, emperor was the spiritual ruler, basic liberties and civil rights, no state religion, women could vote), a peace clause was added to the constitution, education reform to reflect a more US vs German educational system. The San Francisco Peace Treaty (1951) marked the end of the occupation and Japan was again independent.</li>

                <li><em> Post-occupation:</em>
                    After 1952, Japan’s economic power far outreached its prewar military power. The Liberal Democratic Party, which held a majority in the Japanese Diet until 1990s encouraged companies to grow internationally while restricting foreign business growth in Japan. With reliance on the US for defense during the cold war, Japan’s economy grew exponentially. Western movies and music became popular in Japan, while Godzilla movies, anime, manga, and martial arts were exported culturally.</li>

            <p><em>Heisei Period (1989 - ):</em> (Heisei meaning peace everywhere) The current era after the death of Hirohito. Significant events include Japan’s rapid economic growth, with the Nikkei (Japan’s stock market measurement) reaching a record 39,000, before falling to 15,000 in the famed “bubble economy”, a subway sarin gas attack by a doomsday cult, and the reemergence of Japan as an international military in the Gulf War as Japan sends mine sweepers into the region.
