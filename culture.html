            <p>One of the definitions Merriam-Webster has for culture is “the characteristic features of everyday existence shared by a people”. To understand Japanese culture, you have to understand some of these cultural principles that are the basis of the society.</p>

            <h3>Wa (和)</h3>
            <p>"Harmony”, the kanji is also a name for Japan/Japanese. Wa is central in Japan society. Conformity within a social group or peaceful unity where members prefer continued harmony over personal interests. Wa is seen in family life, political parties, and business. Wa in business is achieved by giving an employee a career for life, encouraging loyalty and stability. In business, bonuses and rewards are given to groups, rather than individuals.
            </p>
            <h3>Haji</h3>
            <p>"Shame” is the core of Japanese culture. While in the West, a person has a “sense of guilt” as a result of one’s actions, in Japan, a person feels a great shame as a result of actions. The former is internal, while the latter is an external feeling. In samurai times, being put to public shame was like death.</p>
            <h3>Hare & Ke</h3>
            <p>It is the separation of the special and the mundane. Hare is special, being noticeably cheerful, a formal/special occasion. Ke is everyday ordinary. Hare and Ke is a traditional world-view held by Japanese over time. Originally, hare referred to milestones. “Hare gi” is clothes worn at ritual at milestones (a tuxedo/suit for a man). “Ke gi” is everyday clothing (a T-shirt nowadays). The term is no longer used. </p>

            <h3>Wabi-Sabi</h3>
            <p>Referring to simplicity and serenity in beauty, it is the acceptance of transience and imperfection. Derived from Buddhism, it is the appreciation of beauty that is imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. Characteristics of wabi-sabi include asymmetry, roughness, simplicity austerity, modest and the appreciation of natural objects and nature.</p>
            <h3>Uchi -Soto</h3>
            <p>In-groups and out-groups, the distinction is reflected in custom and language. The group you’re in changes and is dependent on the context, situation, and your age group. A boss would use casual language with subordinates but would use honorific/formal language with his boss. He would also use polite terms when referring to the employee’s family, but use plain language when speaking about his own. In terms of customs, the most senior family member takes a bath first, but if an outsider is visiting, they are given first priority and best sleeping arrangement, even if it inconveniences the family. The out-group must be honored and the in-group humbled in the philosophy. But it is also very difficult for non-Japanese to be accepted as an uchi member of Japanese society.</p>

            <h3>Honne & Tatemae</h3>
            <p>Honne are your feelings and desires. They may differ from what is expected of you and therefore not honestly expressed. Tatemae is the behavior and opinions expressed officially. For a densely populated culture, requiring cooperation and conflict avoidance, and living through austerity at times, hone and tatemae may be a cultural necessity. This philosophy may be the reason Japanese go to great lengths to avoid conflict.</p>
            <h3>Mono no aware</h3>
            <p>Being witness to the ephemeral nature of beauty and knowing none of it lasts. Being basically appreciative, but saddened when encountering things outside your daily life. This includes life and mortality.</p>

            <h3>Mujo</h3>
            <p>The impermanence of all things, that all things are in a state of transition and eventually disintegrate. The West seeks beauty in eternal things, the Japanese have a tendency to seek beauty in things in transformation.</p>
            <h3>Kaizen</h3>
            <p>The Japanese concept of continual improvement as a daily process in all standardized activities and processes. At work it encourages employees to experiment in the workplace to increase efficiency, eliminate waste and overly hard work. The idea is to encourage and praise employees in their participation in kaizen activities.</p>
            <h3>Fuzei</h3>
            <p>Generally refers to the aesthetic sense of beauty/atmosphere/mood found in seeing simple, fragile or empty objects deteriorated by nature over time. Similar to Mono no aware, the term is still in use, while mono no aware is not.</p>
            <h3>Fudōshin</h3>
            <p>Frequently used in the philosophy and mentality of Japanese martial arts, it is the state of balanced calmness, evenness of temper and firmness of mind. Literally meaning immovable mind, immovable heart or unmoving heart.</p>

            <h3>Zan-Shin</h3>
            <p>"Without interruption of the mind”, it refers to your state of mind after a competition or performance. It involves your consciousness/alertness after a performance, while relaxing. In competition, it refers to being careful, attentive and fair. With an opponent, you should be fair, modest, calm, and thankful to have an opponent to compete against and improve yourself. It is also never letting your guard down with an opponent after making a successful move or being ready for a counter attack. In daily life, it is respecting and thinking of the other party. The term is used in teaching manners or putting an orderly end to a thing or action, like closing the door gently instead of slamming it shut, or cleaning up after a job. When having visitors, the host should see off the leaving guest until the guest is no longer visible and then not hurry into the house, but ponder that the same meaning will never occur again.</p>
            <h3>Mottainai</h3>
            <p>Conveying a sense of regret concerning waste, uttered in present day Japan it’s equivalent to “don’t waste!” in referring to time, food, or other resource. In ancient Japan, it includes a sense of gratitude along with shame when receiving a greater favor than merited from a superior.</p>
            <h3>Omotenashi</h3>
            <p>The way of treating a guest. It blends a welcoming spirit, warmth, understanding and respect without an expectation of favor or reward. It is based on a relationship between equals (host and guest). Japanese language has no distinction between guest and customer, therefore in business, omotenashi means outstanding service and anticipating the customer’s needs while sincerely smiling and setting a relaxed mood. Gratitude toward the customer is a key part, making the one-to-one encounter a warm and unique experience and making the host smile.</p>

            <h3>Kawaii</h3>
            <p>The quality of cuteness in Japanese culture. A Japanese sociology professor suggested that the term includes everything that is acceptable and desirable in Japan. It can refer to people and items that are charming, vulnerable, shy, and childlike. Japanese women who fake kawaii behavior (ex. high pitched voice, squealing giggles) viewed as forced or inauthentic are called burikko (a derogatory term for phony personal style).
