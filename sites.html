            <h1>Japan's Sites to See</h1>
        </header>
        <section id="paragraphs">
            <p>Anyone who has travelled by rail in Europe will have no trouble navigating the Japanese rail system. A Japan Rail Pass (JR Pass) is a cost-effective way to travel long distances for foreigners. For those already in Japan, prepaid IC cards and cash can be used at vending machines to purchase subway and rail tickets. IC cards can also be used for the bus system, but there are different systems requiring different IC cards. Local buses in Tokyo and Osaka are a secondary method of seeing the city. In less dense cities, local buses are the main means of transport within. The highway buses operate in daytime and overnight, or only daytime, or only overnight. Bridges connect the four main islands but an extensive ferry system connects the others.
            </p>
            <p>At your destination, to experience a uniquely Japanese stay, sleep at a capsule hotel, manga café, Buddhist temple or ryokan/minshuku.
