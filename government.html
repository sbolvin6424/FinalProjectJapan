            <h3>Japan has 3 types of elections:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>General elections to the House of Representatives every 4 years</li>
                <li>Elections to the House of Councilors every 3 years (1/2 the councilors)</li>
                <li>Local elections for prefecture and municipalities every 4 years</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Both house elections are held under a parallel voting system, where each individual votes twice. In one ballot, he votes for a person to represent him. In the other ballot, he votes for a party in a proportionality of seats to be allocated. If that party wins a higher proportion more seats will be given from a party’s list of candidates.
            </p>
            <p>289 representatives are single-seat constituency, directly elected, while 176 are proportional representation, elected by a party-list system from 11 multi-member constituencies. The 11 multi-member constituencies are proportional representation (PR) blocks. Each block consists of one or more prefectures, each prefecture divided, and larger regions further divided into one or more single-member district.
            </p>
            <p>Half of the Councilor members are subject to election every 3 years, 147 are directly elected plural-seat prefectural constituency from 47 prefectures and 98 are elected from a nationwide list by proportional representation.

            <h3>Local authorities</h3>
            <p>Japan is divided into 47 administrative divisions, 43 rural prefectures, 2 urban prefectures (Kyoto and Osaka), one “district” (Hokkaido), and one metro district (Tokyo). There are self-governing cities and towns that are independent of larger jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction has an executive (governor in prefectures and mayors for towns and cities) with assembly and committees. Executives and assemblies stand for election every 4 years.</p>
